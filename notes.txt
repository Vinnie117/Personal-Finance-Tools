To do

Short term
- clean up code (put old code into back up archive)
- delete unnecessary comments, comment structure for data import from local vs online (raw.github)
- rename test.py -> functions.py
- clean up update_sankey()
- import sankey plot "fig" as modulue into app.py
- See, if static labels can be printed / annotated to the dashboard

Long-term
- Control horizontal spacing of links
  - https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~alishobeiri/1591/plotly-sankey-diagrams/#/
    - see Energy Forecast Dashboard -> large gap / small gap -> node.pad
- add dynamic elements
- enable import of values with a CSV file? or type them into dynamic elements?
